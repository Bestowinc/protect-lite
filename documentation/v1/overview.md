Digital partners can now embed Bestow’s application in days.

Partners can give customers access to Bestow’s term life offering, without ever routing customers off their
platform to bestow.com.

For platforms offering financial or insurance products that would benefit from adding Bestow’s instant-issue
term life offering, Bestow has now made it possible to embed the user experience within days.

A couple lines of code can add a life insurance entrypoint to the partner’s platform. This CTA brings the user to
Bestow’s digital application, displayed as an iframe on the partner’s site or mobile app. The iframe
implementation implies Bestow is still hosting the front-end, so they can make changes to add new functionality
anytime as well as maintain insights to user behavior on the application itself to prevent against fraud
(e.g. fullstory monitoring). Approved customers can bind and then return to the partner platform.

The application itself is particularly seamless and optimizes for conversion. The iframe leverages Bestow’s most
recent Direct “client”, so all growth learnings are incorporated.

Term life insurance is particularly compelling for partners. The term-component gives it natural longevity, making
it a high retention product to complement platforms that might otherwise constantly battle user churn
(investment apps, P&C insurance, etc.). The commission payout also adds a valuable monetization stream. With the
new iframe solution from Bestow, partners can take advantage of adding an instant-issue term life offering to their
platform in just a matter of days. And if the partnership is extremely successful, the next step is a fully native
integration using Bestow’s Protect SDK.
