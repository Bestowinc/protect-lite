The ability to embed the Bestow application into your website comes in several flavors. They can be combined
depending on the desired user experience.

reduce the amount of integration and configuration needed by partners. Making it as seamless and easy as possible 
and reducing your time to market. All components are written in plain vanilla javascript.
